> **Note** In this project, we can find the following files and folders:
>- The folder 📂 `src/` is the files of this web page: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and images.
>- The folders 📚 `public/` and `docs/`, are generated automatically when we start the project. GULP reads the files found in the src/ folder, processes them and then generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.
>- Other 📝 files found in the repository root as 'gulpfile.js', 'package.json', etc. are configuration files and we don't need to modify them.
>-  To publish on GitHub Pages and generate your page for production run the command: `npm run githubpages`
